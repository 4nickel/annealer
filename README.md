# Annealer

Uses hill-climbing, simulated annealing, frequency analysis and cribbing to solve many classic ciphers in reasonable time.

> _Thanks to Dave Oranchak and Sam Blake for solving the Z340 (Zodiac-Killer cipher) and piquing my interest in these techniques._

To build the project run ``cargo build --release``.
